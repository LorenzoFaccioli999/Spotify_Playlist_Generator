# ðŸŽµ Spotify Top 100 Playlist Generator

This Python script automatically creates a private Spotify playlist populated with the top 100 Billboard songs from a specific historical date chosen by the user. It combines **web scraping** and **Spotifyâ€™s Web API** using `BeautifulSoup` and `Spotipy`.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Given a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, the script:
1. Scrapes the Billboard Hot 100 chart for that day.
2. Searches each track on Spotify using both song title and artist name.
3. Creates a new **private playlist** in the userâ€™s Spotify account.
4. Adds all found tracks (up to 100) to the playlist.

Itâ€™s a great tool to relive the music of a particular dayâ€”be it your birthday, anniversary, or any date from the Billboard archives.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **BeautifulSoup** â€“ for HTML parsing and data extraction from Billboard.com.
